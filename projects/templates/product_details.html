                                <p>Our new Project every processes had become fragmented; meaning quality and service were inconsistent. This lack of standardization was adversely impacting operating costs, productivity and customer satisfaction. For several years now Payfast has worked strategically with innovations as a means of developing new solutions, products and services. In line with this vision, Success was approached to find new payments solutions to offer Payfast customers on their website, including open invoice and partial payments options.</p>
